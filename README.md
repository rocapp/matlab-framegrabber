# matlab-framegrabber
A solution for lots of videos that need to be turned into individual frames --- exports to .MAT

Framegrab1.m: Old version, takes only one video as input and outputs frames as images to folder
Framegrab2.m: New version, takes a list of videos as input and outputs as MAT file, also outputs a list of all videos as a char array.
